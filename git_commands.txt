To Clone a Repository:
	1. Make a new directory for it on local machine
	2. git clone git@github.com:colghost/git_test1.git


git remote -v : shows the URL of the repository

git status : shows which files have been staged/uploaded
	- red: not staged
	- green: staged
	- no output: all changes have been committed

git add filename.txt : adds the file to the staging arae in Git.
git add . :adds all files in current directory and subsequent directories 

git commit -m "Add filename.txt"

git log: shows a log about what files were committed, when, where, and who




The "Cheat Sheet"

Commands related to a remote repository:
    git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
    git push or git push origin main (Both accomplish the same goal in this context)

Commands related to the workflow:
    git add .
    git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"

Commands related to checking status or log history
    git status
    git log

The basic Git syntax is program | action | destination.

For example,

git add . is read as git | add | ., where the period represents everything in the current directory;
git commit -m "message" is read as git | commit -m | "message"; and
git status is read as git | status | (no destination).
